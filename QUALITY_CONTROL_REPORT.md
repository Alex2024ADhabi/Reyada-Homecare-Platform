## 🎯 Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

### 1. Storyboard Loading Failures
**Impact:** High - Affects user experience and platform functionality  
**Current Status:** 45 out of 150 storyboards failing to load  
**Root Causes:**
- Network dependency issues
- Import path resolution failures
- Missing dependency pre-resolution

**Immediate Actions:**
- Implement more robust error handling for storyboard loading
- Add comprehensive offline fallbacks
- Pre-resolve common dependencies at startup
- Implement dependency caching mechanism

### 2. JSX Runtime Initialization
**Impact:** Critical - Can break entire application rendering  
**Current Status:** Intermittent failures detected  
**Root Causes:**
- Race conditions during initialization
- Missing global React availability
- Vite dependency scanning issues

**Immediate Actions:**
- Ensure JSX runtime initialization happens before any component loading
- Add multiple fallback strategies for React global availability
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed initializations
