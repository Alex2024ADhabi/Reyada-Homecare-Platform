### Implementation Strategy
1. **Create Individual Service Files** for each major category
2. **Replace Simulation Methods** with actual implementation calls
3. **Implement Gradual Rollout** - one category at a time
4. **Add Real Validation** - actual health checks instead of hardcoded 100%
5. **Create Integration Tests** for each implemented subtask

### Priority Order
1. **Security** (highest risk if missing)
2. **Compliance** (regulatory requirements)
3. **Performance** (user experience)
4. **Services** (feature completeness)

### Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1 (Services): 3-4 weeks
- Phase 2 (Compliance): 4-5 weeks  
- Phase 3 (Performance): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 4 (Security): 3-4 weeks

**Total Estimated Time: 12-16 weeks for full implementation**
