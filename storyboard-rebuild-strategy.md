# Storyboard Rebuild Strategy

## Current Status
- Platform experiencing performance issues due to 400+ storyboards
- Emergency cleanup in progress to reduce to 5 essential storyboards
- Canvas errors and memory issues being resolved

## Phase 1: Stabilization (In Progress)
Keeping only essential storyboards:
- AdvancedRobustnessValidationStoryboard
- MasterHealthDashboardStoryboard
- UnifiedAnalyticsDashboardStoryboard
- BusinessIntelligenceDashboardStoryboard
- PredictiveRiskAssessmentStoryboard

## Phase 2: Validation (Next)
- [ ] Verify platform stability
- [ ] Test canvas performance
- [ ] Validate core functionality
- [ ] Ensure development environment stability

## Phase 3: Strategic Rebuild (Future)
### Priority 1: Core Healthcare Components
- Patient Management storyboards
- Clinical Documentation storyboards
- DOH Compliance storyboards
- Revenue Management storyboards

### Priority 2: Administrative Components
- Staff Management storyboards
- Reporting storyboards
- Communication storyboards

### Priority 3: Advanced Features
- AI Analytics storyboards
- Integration storyboards
- Mobile-specific storyboards

## Storyboard Management Best Practices

### Performance Guidelines
- Maximum 20-30 storyboards at any time
- Regular cleanup of unused storyboards
- Monitor memory usage during development
- Use lazy loading for complex components

### Development Workflow
1. Create storyboard only when needed
2. Test performance impact immediately
3. Remove storyboard when feature is complete
4. Use component libraries instead of duplicate storyboards

### Monitoring
- Track storyboard count weekly
- Monitor canvas performance metrics
- Set up alerts for excessive storyboard creation
- Regular performance audits

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Stabilization
- Complete emergency cleanup
- Validate platform stability
- Test core functionality

### Week 2: Core Rebuild
- Rebuild 5-10 most critical storyboards
- Test performance after each addition
- Implement monitoring

### Week 3+: Gradual Expansion
- Add storyboards based on priority
- Maximum 3-5 new storyboards per week
- Continuous performance monitoring

## Success Metrics
- Canvas loads without errors
- Development server starts in <30 seconds
- Memory usage stays below 2GB
- No performance degradation during development
- Stable hot module replacement (HMR)

## Risk Mitigation
- Automated storyboard count monitoring
- Performance regression testing
- Rollback procedures for problematic storyboards
- Regular cleanup schedules
